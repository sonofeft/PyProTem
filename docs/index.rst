PyProTem
========

PyProTem acts as a temporary project to test tox, travis, futurize, etc.

The layout is shown below::

    PyProTem/
        pyprotem/
            __init__.py
            main.py
        docs/
        tests/
            __init__.py
            test_mycode.py
        LICENSE.txt
        MANIFEST.in
        README.rst
        requirements.txt
        setup.cfg
        setup.py
        tk_nosy.py
        tox.ini

Use PyProTem to test tox usage locally, travis CI on GitHub on checkin, tk_nosy to watch files locally and alert breakage, operation under both python 2 and 3.
